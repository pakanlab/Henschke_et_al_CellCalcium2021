### *Enhanced modulation of cell-type specific neuronal responses in mouse dorsal auditory field during locomotion*

MATLAB code from the Pakan lab used for analysis in this paper. 
Analysis pipeline for caclium imaging orignially developed in the lab of Nathalie Rocehfort (University of Edinburgh) and expanded and adapted in the Pakan lab.

## General notes
- The functions used for analysis are defined in **getFuncHandleRGroup.m**. 
These files can be found in the folder **\analysis**.
The analysis functions may call other specific functions (e.g. compute_lmi.m), which can be found in **\analysis\projectfunctions**, 
as well as utilities tools (e.g. for data handling) which are in the folder **\analysis\utilities**.
- Code downloaded from external sources can be found in the folder **\external** (licence in corresponding folder).
- The documentation for each function can be found in the corresponding matlab files.

Functions specific to individual Figures are as follows:

## Figure 2 - sensory-evoked MI

## Figure 4 - locomotion MI
